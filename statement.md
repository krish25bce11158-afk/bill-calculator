# Project Statement: Restaurant Bill Calculator

## 1. Introduction
The Restaurant Bill Calculator is a Python-based console application designed to demonstrate how basic data structures—specifically **lists** and **tuples**—can be used to manage menu items and process customer orders. The project focuses on simple billing logic, user input handling, and formatted output generation.

## 2. Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a functional billing system that:
- Displays a menu of food items with prices.
- Allows users to select items by number.
- Stores selections in a list.
- Calculates the total bill amount.
- Generates a clear and readable receipt.

## 3. Problem Definition
Restaurants often require a simple billing mechanism for small-scale operations or learning purposes. This project solves the problem by:
- Offering predefined menu items stored as tuples.
- Allowing ordered items to be dynamically added to a list.
- Summing item prices to compute the final bill.

## 4. Scope of the Project
This project is intended for:
- Students learning Python basics.
- Beginners exploring data structures.
- Anyone wanting a simple billing console program.

The program does **not** include advanced features such as taxes, discounts, quantity selection, or graphical interfaces—keeping the focus on fundamental logic.

## 5. Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- Tuples for menu items (immutable)
- Lists for storing orders (dynamic)
- Console I/O for user interactions

## 6. Methodology
1. **Menu Creation:**  
   A list of tuples stores item names and prices.
2. **User Interaction:**  
   Users select items by entering item numbers.
3. **Validation:**  
   Input is validated to prevent invalid entries.
4. **Billing Logic:**  
   Selected items are added to a list, and their prices summed.
5. **Output:**  
   A formatted receipt displays all items and the total bill.

## 7. Conclusion
The Restaurant Bill Calculator successfully demonstrates how Python's basic data structures and control flow mechanisms can be used to create a practical, real-world application. The project is simple, extendable, and ideal for beginners.
