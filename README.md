# bill-calculator
A simple Python-based Restaurant Bill Calculator using lists and tuples. Coustomers can select menu items by number, and the program generates a accurate receipt with the total bill.


**1. Overview of the Project**

The Restaurant Bill Calculator is a program that allows users to select food items from a predefined menu and calculates the final bill with taxes and other charges included.

The menu is implemented using tuples (to keep item names & prices fixed), while the customer’s selections are stored in a list.
This project demonstrates practical usage of Python data structures, loops, input validation, and formatted console output.

**2. Features**
Menu stored as a list of tuples
User selects items by m
Clean and formatted receipt output
Automatic calculation of total bill
Easy to extend or modify in future

Python 3.x
Built-in data structures:
Tuple → for menu items
List → for storing ordered items
Console-based I/O (no external packages)
